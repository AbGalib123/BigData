## Assignment Part-1
Q1. Why do we call Python as a general purpose and high-level programming language?
Sol:Python is an object-oriented, high-level programming language. Object-oriented means
    this language is based around objects (such as data) rather than functions, and high-level
    means it's easy for humans to understand.High-level language is nothing but the language 
    which is having higher level of abstraction


Q2. Why is Python called a dynamically typed language?
Sol:Dynamic languages allow programmers to modify even change the structure while running.
    It is known as Run-time modification.And Python falls into this type of programming language


Q3. List some pros and cons of Python programming language?
Sol:    Pros of Python                Cons of Python
     1. Beginner-Friendly          1. Issues with Design
     2. Large Community            2. Slower than Compiled Language
     3. Flexible and Extensible    3. Security
     4. Extensive Libraries        4. Work Environment
     5. Embeddable                 5. Python’s Memory Consumption and Garbage Collection
     6. Highly Scalable            6. Python is Dynamically Typed
     7. IOT Opportunities          7. Multithreading in Python
     8. Machine Learning
     9. Portable


Q4. In what all domains can we use Python?
Sol:Web development.
    Data science.
    OS development.
    Scientific programming.
    Gaming.


Q5. What are variable and how can we declare them?
Sol:Variable:
            A name given to a specific memory location.
    Declaration of variable 
    eg; a = 5 ~SDimple virable diclaration
    -any variable names should start with alphabet
    -we can not use any special symbol in variable 
    -we can only use underscore (_) as a part of variable name
    -any variable name can start from underscore


Q6. How can we take an input from the user in Python?
Sol:We take an input from the user in Python by using "input()" function

    eg: name = input("Enter value for name =")
        age =  input("Enter value for age =")


Q7. What is the default datatype of the value that has been taken as an input
     using input() function?
Sol:String Data Type.


Q8. What is type casting?
Sol:The conversion of one data type into the other data type is known as Type Casting.


Q9. Can we take more than one input from the user using single input() function? If yes, how?
    If no, why?
Sol:

Q10. What are keywords?
Sol: Keywords are special reserved words that have specific meanings and purposes and 
     can't be used for anything but those specific purposes.


Q11. Can we use keywords as a variable? Support your answer with reason.
Sol: We cannot use keyword as a variable . Its because keywords have predefined meanings.


Q12. What is indentation? What's the use of indentaion in Python?
Sol:Indentation refers to the spaces at the beginning of a code line.
    Python uses indentation to indicate a block of code.


Q13. How can we throw some output in Python?
Sol: The basic way to do output is the print statement.i.e.,print("")


Q14. What are operators in Python?
Sol: In Python, operators are special symbols that designate that some sort of computation 
     should be performed.like(+,-,>,<,/,//,%)


Q15. What is difference between / and // operators?
SOL: / Is for intiger type division, // Is for float type division


Q16. Write a code that gives following as an output.
     iNeuroniNeuroniNeuroniNeuron
Sol: print("iNeuroniNeuroniNeuroniNeuron")


Q17. Write a code to take a number as an input from the user and check 
     if the number is odd or even.
Sol:num = int(input("Enter the number ="))

    if num % 2==0:
        print("Given number is Even")
    else:
        print("Given number is odd")



Q18. What are boolean operator?
Sol: The logical operators and, or and not are also referred to as boolean operators. 
     While and as well as or operator needs two operands, which may evaluate to true or false, 
     not operator needs one operand evaluating to true or false. Boolean and operator returns 
     true if both operands return true

Q19. What will the output of the following?

1 or 0

0 and 0

True and False and True

1 or 0 or 0


Q20. What are conditional statements in Python?
Sol: A conditional statement as the name suggests itself, is used to handle conditions in 
     your program. These statements guide the program while making decisions based on the 
     conditions encountered by the program. Python has 3 key Conditional Statements that you 
     should know: if statement, if-else statement, nested if statment.


Q21. What is use of 'if', 'elif' and 'else' keywords?
Sol: It allows us to check for multiple expressions. If the condition for if is False , 
     it checks the condition of the next elif block and so on. If all the conditions are False,
     the body of else is executed.


Q22. Write a code to take the age of person as an input and if age >= 18 display "I can vote". 
     If age is < 18 display "I can't vote".
Sol: num = int(input("Enter your age ="))

     if num >= 18:
         print("I can vote")
     else:
         print("I can't vote")
 


Q23. Write a code that displays the sum of all the even numbers from the given list.
     numbers = [12, 75, 150, 180, 145, 525, 50]



Q24. Write a code to take 3 numbers as an input from the user and display the greatest no as output.

Q25. Write a program to display only those numbers from a list that satisfy the following conditions

- The number must be divisible by five

- If the number is greater than 150, then skip it and move to the next number

- If the number is greater than 500, then stop the loop

numbers = [12, 75, 150, 180, 145, 525, 50]
